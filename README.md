# Search Options #

This is the search interface that users use to make quereies about animals. Things that can be selected are the city to act as the center of the search, the radius of the search, the kind of animal (dog, cat, barnyard, bird, and more),  as well as the age of animals to search for. Any number of these options can be combined to make the most specific search. 


# Swiping Cards #

Once the search is done and results are found the user is prompted with this screen. From here they are able to interact using swipes, either to the left or the right depending on how they like the dog. A rightward swipe will add the dog to their liked list which can be viewed at a later time. If the user prefers they can use the buttons on the bottom to indicate their choice. The middle button acts as an undo which returns the previous animal card back to the top. The others are fairly self explanatory. 


# Liked Animals #

Once the user is done swiping on different animals they can visit their liked page to see all of the animals that they liked during their interactions. Liked animals are displayed with a picture and more information about the animal as well as some options to contact the shelter, view more information about the animal, or remove them from the list. The image can be clicked to enlarge it as it can sometimes appeaer off centered or distorted. 


# Profile Page #

This displays information about how many times the user has swiped on an animal, how many of those swipes were a like, and how many pets are currently liked by them. It also shows a few other things in their email, name, and profile picture. This is the one stop shop to view statistics about your interaction on the app.
